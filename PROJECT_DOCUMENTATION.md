# SecureShare - Secure File Sharing System

## 📋 Project Overview

**SecureShare** is a web-based secure file-sharing system built for educational purposes as a graduation project. It demonstrates enterprise-grade security features including AES-256 encryption, RSA key exchange, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control.

## 🔐 Security Features

### 1. AES-256 Encryption
- **Purpose**: Protects file content from unauthorized access
- **Implementation**: Each file is encrypted using AES-256-CBC before storage
- **Process**:
  - Generate random 256-bit AES key for each file
  - Encrypt file content with AES-256
  - Store encrypted data in MongoDB
  - File content is never stored in plain text

### 2. RSA Encryption (2048-bit)
- **Purpose**: Secure key exchange mechanism
- **Implementation**: 
  - Each user receives an RSA keypair (public/private) on registration
  - AES keys are encrypted with user's RSA public key
  - Only the user's private key can decrypt the AES key
  - Enables secure file sharing without exposing encryption keys

### 3. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Type**: Email-based OTP (One-Time Password)
- **Implementation**:
  - 6-digit OTP generated on login
  - OTP expires after 5 minutes
  - Demo mode: OTP displayed on screen (for graduation demo)
  - Production: OTP sent via email service
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access even with compromised passwords

### 4. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Roles**:
  - **User**: Can upload, download, share, and delete own files
  - **Admin**: All user permissions + access to user management and audit logs
- **Enforcement**: JWT token-based authentication with role validation

### 5. Cryptographic Hashing (SHA-256)
- **Purpose**: File integrity verification
- **Implementation**:
  - SHA-256 hash computed before encryption
  - Hash stored with file metadata
  - Verified on download to detect tampering
  - Ensures data integrity throughout lifecycle

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: React with professional UI components
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Cryptography**: Python `cryptography` library
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with bcrypt password hashing

## 🔄 Data Flow

### File Upload Flow
1. User selects file in UI
2. Frontend sends file to backend
3. Backend:
   - Computes SHA-256 hash (integrity)
   - Generates random AES-256 key
   - Encrypts file with AES-256
   - Encrypts AES key with user's RSA public key
   - Stores encrypted data and encrypted key in MongoDB
4. Returns file metadata to frontend
5. Logs action in audit log

### File Download Flow
1. User requests file download
2. Backend verifies:
   - User authentication (JWT)
   - User authorization (owner or shared with)
3. Backend:
   - Retrieves encrypted data and encrypted AES key
   - Decrypts AES key using user's RSA private key
   - Decrypts file content using AES key
   - Verifies integrity using SHA-256 hash
4. Returns decrypted file to user
5. Logs action in audit log

### File Sharing Flow
1. Owner specifies recipient email
2. Backend:
   - Validates recipient exists
   - Adds recipient to file's `shared_with` list
3. Recipient can now decrypt using their own RSA private key
4. Logs sharing action

## 🚀 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login and receive OTP
- `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` - Verify OTP and get JWT token
- `POST /api/auth/resend-otp` - Resend OTP

### File Management
- `POST /api/files/upload` - Upload and encrypt file

## 📊 Demo Credentials

For graduation demo purposes, you can create accounts with different roles:

**Regular User**:
- Email: `user@example.com`
- Password: `user123`
- Role: `user`

**Admin User**:
- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Role: `admin`

**Note**: OTP is displayed on screen for demo purposes.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Production Recommendations
1. **Email Service**: Integrate real email service (SendGrid, AWS SES) for OTP delivery
2. **Key Storage**: Consider hardware security modules (HSM) for key management
3. **File Storage**: Move to dedicated object storage (S3, Azure Blob) for scalability
4. **HTTPS**: Ensure all communications use TLS/SSL
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
6. **Password Policy**: Enforce strong password requirements
7. **Session Management**: Implement token refresh and revocation
8. **Audit Logging**: Expand logging for compliance requirements

### Current Limitations (Demo)
- OTP displayed on screen (not sent via email)
- Files stored in MongoDB (not ideal for large files)
- Private keys stored in database (acceptable for demo, use HSM in production)
- No file size limits implemented
- No file type validation

## 📈 System Statistics

The admin dashboard displays:
- Total registered users
- Total encrypted files
- Total system actions/events
- Complete audit trail
